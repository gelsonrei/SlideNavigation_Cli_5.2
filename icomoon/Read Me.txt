find your icons in 
https://icomoon.io/app/#/select


After you have your font, it’s time to add to your project. Add the font into {touch_app}/resources/fonts/, and add this path to your resources/sass/config.rb:

# Compass configurations
sass_path = dir
css_path = File.join(dir, "..", "css")
fonts_path = File.join(dir, "..", "fonts")

 It’s also good to copy the pictos and  ios7  folder from touch/resources/themes/fonts to this new fonts/ directory.

For the last step you just need to include the font and use the icons on your app.scss, like this:

@include icon-font('icomoon', inline-font-files(
  'icomoon.woff', woff,
  'icomoon.ttf', truetype,
  'icomoon.svg', svg
));
 
@include icon("menu"  , "\e602","icomoon");
@include icon("list", "\e600","icomoon");
@include icon("list2"  , "\e601","icomoon");
